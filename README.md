# Single-Cell-Imaging-Analysis-of-HCC-Data
Current molecular classification is often based on cancer cell-intrinsic genomic features, which disregards contribution of the tumor microenvironment and lacks spatial context. Here, we develop an imaging-based tumor classification system by integrating both sources of information. We first trained a multi-task deep learning neural network for automated single-cell segmentation and classification, and applied to whole-slide hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue section images of 304 hepatocellular carcinoma. Given the single-cell map, we calculated 246 quantitative image features to characterize individual nuclei as well as spatial distribution and interaction between tumor cells and lymphocytes. Unsupervised consensus clustering revealed three reproducible imaging subtypes associated with distinct genetic and molecular features. Further, these imaging subtypes complement established molecular classification and demonstrate independent prognostic value beyond conventional clinicopathologic risk factors.
